AI is already displacing these jobs

人工智能已经取代了这些工作

根据麻省理工学院 (MIT) 的《2025 年商业人工智能现状报告》，人工智能目前还不会取代你的工作。相反，人工智能主要取代的是外包的离岸工人。

重要性：麻省理工学院的研究结果表明，鉴于美国工人正饱受劳动力市场紧缩的痛苦，以及对白领阶层血洗的担忧，人工智能带来的任何颠覆性影响都波及范围更广，尽管其长期风险要大得多。

他们的说法是：“似乎没有任何裁员……受影响最大的工作已经是优先级较低的或外包的了，”麻省理工学院 NANDA 项目的研究贡献者 Aditya Challapally 告诉 Axios。

报告称，企业并非取代员工，而是从“取代 BPO（业务流程外包）和外部机构，而不是裁减内部员工”中获得了真正的收益。
放眼未来：虽然短期内3%的工作岗位可能被人工智能取代，但Challapally表示，从长远来看，近27%的工作岗位可能被人工智能取代。

被认为是人工智能先进应用领域的行业将看到近期对劳动力的影响。
在科技和媒体这两个仅有的两个显示出明显受到人工智能颠覆迹象的行业中，超过80%的受访高管预计未来两年的招聘量将减少。
不过，大多数受访公司目前正在用人工智能来填补员工空缺，而不是取代他们。
从数据来看：目前，公司并没有解雇员工，而是取消了涉及外包劳动力的合同，这种策略正在带来经济效益。

后台自动化也具有更高的投资回报率，麻省理工学院研究人员研究的公司减少了200万至1000万美元的BPO支出。
一家受访公司通过花费8000美元购买人工智能工具，每年节省了800万美元。
言外之意：根据估算，50% 的 AI 预算流向了销售和市场营销。

这可能表明，尽管后台工具节省了更多资金，但前台工具却获得了更多投资。
衡量前台 AI 驱动的成功也变得更加困难。（例如，很难判断 AI 是否帮助你在一年内完成了更多销售。）
明智之举：对于押注 AI 能提高生产力的投资者来说，这份报告既带来了希望，也带来了风险。

95% 投资生成式 AI 的机构的投资回报为零。
但 Challapally 表示，企业正在经历“生产力的显著提高”。
总而言之：如果 AI 能够以一种帮助企业削减成本且不造成大规模裁员的方式提高生产力，那么对投资者来说，这可能是一个理想的投资场景——既能刺激盈利增长，又能避免大规模失业带来的经济拖累。

Artificial intelligence is not taking your job just yet, according to MIT's State of AI in Business 2025 report. Instead, AI is predominantly replacing outsourced, offshore workers.

Why it matters: As U.S. workers feel the pain of a tight labor market coupled with fears of a white-collar bloodbath, any disruption from AI is so far hitting farther afield, the MIT findings suggest, even though its longer-term risk is much greater.

What they're saying: "There doesn't seem to be any layoffs. … Jobs most impacted were already low priority or outsourced," Aditya Challapally, research contributor to project NANDA at MIT, tells Axios.

Instead of replacing workers, organizations are finding real gains from "replacing BPOs [business process outsourcing] and external agencies, not cutting internal staff," according to the report.
Zoom out: While 3% of jobs could be replaced by AI in the short term, Challapally said that nearly 27% of jobs could be replaced by AI in the longer term.

Industries that are considered advanced adopters of AI see the nearest-term labor impact.
Over 80% of executives surveyed within tech and media, the only two sectors that showed clear signs of AI disruption, anticipate reduced hiring volumes in the next two years.
Still, most companies surveyed are currently backfilling workers with AI, for example, rather than replacing them.
By the numbers: For now, companies aren't firing employees but just canceling contracts that involve outsourced labor, a strategy that's leading to financial gains.

Back-office automations also have a higher return on investment, with $2 million to $10 million in BPO expenditures eliminated for the firms studied by MIT researchers.
One company studied saved $8 million a year by spending $8,000 on an AI tool.
Between the lines: 50% of AI budgets flow to sales and marketing, based on estimates.

That could indicate that front-office tools are getting more investment even though back-office tools save more money.
It can also be harder to measure front-office AI-driven successes. (It's difficult to tell if AI helped you close more sales in a year, for example.)
Be smart: For investors betting on AI to drive productivity gains, the report offers hope and risks.

95% of organizations investing in generative AI are getting zero return on that investment.
But companies are seeing "significant increased productivity," Challapally says.
The bottom line: If AI boosts productivity in a way that helps companies cut costs without causing mass layoffs, it could be a Goldilocks scenario for investors — fueling earnings growth while avoiding the economic drag of widespread job losses.
